PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development. I'm gonna try to learn how it works and demonstrate how it reacts with front-end and back-end development.

First, we will need to [download][download] a format that fits into you operating system.

BINARY PACKAGES

Pre-built binary packages are available for a number of different operating system:

+ BSD
    + FreeBSD
    + OpenBSD
+ Linux
    + Red Hat family Linux (including CentOS/Fedora/Scientific/Oracle variants)
    + Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives
    + Ubuntu Linux and derivatives
    + SuSE and OpenSuSE
    + Other Linux
+ macOS
+ Solaris
+ Windows

If you're using macOS, I recommend installing PostgreSQL via command line using homebrew and homebrew services to start and stop PostgreSQL.
