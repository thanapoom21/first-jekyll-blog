We might have heard the terms "AWS" or "Amazon S3" but not really sure what they are capable of doing.

In this article, I'll talk about one of the Amazon Web Services - AWS or Amazon S3.

Imaging if you can store all your stuffs on the cloud. Literally, I mean the cloud in the sky. It's huge and it can move to anywhere in the world. However, it turns out that we can only store our data in the cloud. There's a ton of data out there that we can use and store. Amazon S3 gives us a chance to do that and it's packed with a lot of features and plenty of options to choose from.

You can choose between Standard, Standard - Infrequent Access Storage, or Reduced Redundancy Storage.

However, [On-Demand Storage][on-demand-storage] is another way you can store your data on your own budget. It lets you pay for storage by GB with no long-term commitments freeing you from the cost and effort of planning, estimating and purchasing storage capacity ahead of time.
