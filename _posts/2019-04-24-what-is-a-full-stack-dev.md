It sounds like a full-stack developer is a well-rounded person who can brilliantly answers all questions related to technology. Is it true? Kind of. In order to become a full-stack developer, one needs to know front-end and back-end development but what are those things anyway?

Front-end development mainly includes website skeleton or HTML, website appearance or CSS, and an interactivity of the website or JavaScript. Also, frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue are getting more popular due to its' great documentation, massive community support, implementation, speed.

Back-end development involves server-side programming languages such as java, php, python. Plus, being able to work with databases is preferable. Both relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle and non-relational database like MongoDB, CouchDB, and Cassandra.

Project Management is another important aspect of being a full-stack developer. Is it comfortable for you to work with clients, designers, and developers and complete a project with ease? Timelines of a specific project, infrastructure decisions, and correct requirements are your concerns.

One of the most popular stacks is MEAN which is MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, and NodeJS. There are a bunch of dev stacks out there and it depends on where you are.
