What does JavaScript return on the following expressions?

4 % 2; <--- returns 0
4 % 3; <-- returns 1

4 % 5; <--- returns 4 because 4 cannot be normally divided by 5.

Then we can ask JavaScript questions such as:

4 % 2 === 0; <-- which means, when I divide 4 by 2 do I get a remainder of zero? For which JavaScript will reply with Boolean true

4% 3 === 0; <-- returns false

4%3 === 1; <-- returns true
