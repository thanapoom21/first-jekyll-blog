## Basic Design Principles for Those Who Care

### 1. Alignment

It refers to a position of elements such as shapes, texts, or images in which they are lined up to create a pleasant outcome. We all use it or see it in our daily life. It helps create ordered appearance showing that the aligned elements are connected to each other and create a sense of organization. It is a way to clean up a design while in development and eliminate clumps of graphics or text. Generally, we often see that elements can be aligned horizontally or vertically. However, the relationship between graphics and text across the background or the artboard are very important.

### 2. Hierarchy

It emphasizes how important of a certain element is. A big and bold text block or a full-width image takes up space so it must be the most important thing on the page. People are trying to read or scan from larger elements to smaller ones.

### 3. Contrast

Contrast refers to how different elements are in a design. Too little contrast can make it hard for people to distinguish between elements or too much contrast can ruin your overall design.

### 4. Repetition

Reinforcing an idea by repeting shapes, colors, typefaces, can send a signal to users or viewers that they are all related.

### 5. Proximity

### 6. Balance

It means the distribution of design elements. Certain objects or elements can be intepreted as lighter or heavier in a composition if the design is divided in half. There are two main types of balance in design; symmetry and asymmetry. A symmetrical design is quite simple because the elements look identical on both sides, on the other hand, an asymmetrical design provides a more interesting aspect and usually is more difficult to craft.

- Counter: An area of a letter that is entirely or partially enclosed, such as the hole in an "O" or a "P" character.
- Drop cap: where the first letter of a paragraph is an enlarged capital letter.
- Font pairing: A combination of fonts that work well together in a design.
- Line height: Also called leading, this is the distance between two lines of type. It's calculated by measuring between the two baselines.
- Pull quote: A quotation which is taken from the body text and styled differently in order to make it stand out.
- Type ratio: The difference between the largest and smallest font size.
- Type scales: A method for creating balanced and harmonious font sizing.
- x-height: The distance between the baseline and the mean line of the lower-case letters. A tip is to look at the height of a lower-case letter x, hence the name.
